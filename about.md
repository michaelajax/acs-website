Hi, my name is Mike Ajax and I’m the founder and owner of Ajax Computer Services. I started up my business in 2006 as a sophomore in high school in the town where I grew up. It started off with my first client – a neighbor of mine who was having issues with a spyware infection on her computer. Shortly after resolving the issue on her computer, I got a call from a neighbor of hers who had a similar issue with his PC – she had been happy with my work and referred me to him.

My business continued to grow, entirely through word of mouth, until I had a large and ever-growing customer base of both home users and local small business owners. A few years later, I moved up to Milwaukee to start studying for a degree in electrical engineering, and spent every break from school that I had back home working for my clients who were saving up the work they needed done for me to get back.

Fast forward four years, and I have graduated school, accepted a job in Milwaukee, and permanently moved there, bringing my business with me.

I personally guarantee that you will be satisfied with my work, and I will do everything I can to ensure that you are. After all, your satisfaction is what keeps my business going, as I still do not actively advertise and rely entirely on word of mouth to grow my business.

I look forward to speaking with you, and hope that I can help you to your utmost satisfaction. Feel free to connect with me and get in touch over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajaxmike/).
