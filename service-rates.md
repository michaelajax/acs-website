# Remote Service
We offer remote service for Windows 7, 8 and 10-based PCs. This allows us to perform tune-ups, virus removals and other services over the phone without having to make a house/office call or have the computer dropped off to our shop. With the exception of serious virus issues and hardware issues, most services are available remotely. If an issue cannot be fixed remotely, then in-home/office or in-shop service will be available at our regular rates without an additional charge for the remote service attempt.

For commercial customers, we offer remote service for networking, Windows and Mac PC support through our Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.
