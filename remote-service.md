Ajax Computer Services is proud to offer remote service, called Ajax Computer Services Live Support. This tool lets your computer establish a connection directly to us in order to allow us to solve your problem over the internet without having to drop off your machine or have a service call to your home or business. By simply installing our Live Support application on your PC and arranging an appointment with us, we can remotely repair your PC with just the click of a mouse.

We offer this service at the same hourly rate as our drop-off labor, as described on the Service Rates page. If the problem is unable to be corrected over the internet, you can drop off your PC or schedule an in-home/in-office appointment at our regular rates, and there will be no charge for the attempt to resolve your issue remotely.

Ajax Computer Services Live Support is a great solution for the following services:

- Removing minor Spyware/Virus infections
- Installing and configuring printers and other devices
- General PC Tune-Ups
- Computer Training

Ajax Computer Services Live Support is available for 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. Unfortunately at this time, Apple Mac computers are not supported. We still offer full drop-off and in-home/in-office service for Macs.
